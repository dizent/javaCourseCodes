> ParallelGC汇总分析：
>
> - 堆内存更大，GC频率更低，内存分配速率更高，对象晋升速率更高，GC暂停时间更长
> - 堆内存更小，GC更频繁，FullGC次数更多，内存分配速率更低，对象晋升速率更慢，GC暂停时间短
> - 年轻代使用 PSYoungGen 垃圾采集器，老年代使用 ParOldGen 垃圾采集器

**分析：**

1. 一共进行了18次YoungGc，用时480ms
2. 一共进行了2次FullGc，用时100ms
3. 年轻代一共占用153.56M空间，Eden区136.5M，from和to区都为17M
4. 平均GC暂停时间16.4ms,最大GC暂停时间70ms，最短暂停时间为0ms
5. 一共创建了2.21gb的对象，晋升到老年代的对象有529.12M。垃圾回收第一次到结束一共经历990ms
6. 内存的分配速率为2.38gb/s,对象的晋升速率为534.46M/s



> CMSGC汇总分析：
>
> - 堆内存更大，GC频率更低，内存分配速率更高，对象晋升速率更高，GC暂停时间更长
> - 堆内存更小，GC更频繁，FullGC次数更多，内存分配速率更低，对象晋升速率更慢，GC暂停时间短
> - 年轻代使用 parNew 垃圾采集器，老年代使用 CMS 垃圾采集器
> - STW时间相比SerialGC以及ParallelGC更短，流程为：初始化标记--标记预清理--并发标记--并发清理--最终标记--最终清理

**分析：**

1. 一共进行了25次YoungGc，用时110ms
2. 一共进行了29次FullGc，用时190ms
3. 年轻代一共占用14单位空间，survivors占用4单位空间,1单位空间为1024kb大小
4. 平均GC暂停时间3.5ms,最大GC暂停时间20ms，最短暂停时间为0ms
5. 一共创建了2.57gb的对象，晋升到老年代的对象有338.1M。垃圾回收第一次到结束一共经历969ms
6. 内存的分配速率为2.65gb/s,对象的晋升速率为348.92M/s



> G1GC汇总分析：
>
> - 堆内存更大，GC频率更低，内存分配速率更高，对象晋升速率更高，GC暂停时间更长
> - 堆内存更小，GC更频繁，FullGC次数更多，内存分配速率更低，对象晋升速率更慢，GC暂停时间短
> - 将整个堆内存进行分块，每块堆内存所分配的区域都会有改变的情况，不会将分代模型按比例进行堆内存的分配。优化了堆内存的使用效率。GC时间相比其他GC更短，但是GC更频繁。
